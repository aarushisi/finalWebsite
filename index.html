                            <h3>Computer Science Student</h3>
                        </div>
                        <p>I'm a junior studying Computer Science at the University of Michigan. My coding adventure all started from when I was in in high school when I built my first website using just HTML and CSS. Seeing my ideas come to life on the screen had me hooked, and I knew programming was the field for me. Now, I'm taking courses like Web Systems and Computer Vision to level up my skills. </p>
                        
                        <p>I'm passionate about backend development, AI, and machine learning, and I love learning new tools and frameworks. I have hands-on experience in full-stack development from my internship and am actively working on a team project to create an application using React. Additionally, as an officer in the Society of Women Engineers, I help organize corporate sessions and host our annual banquet, developing my leadership skills and fostering a strong community for women in technology.</p>

                        <p>What sets me apart is my enthusiasm for exploring new technologies and my dedication to continuous learning. In my free time, I experiment with new recipes and enjoy staying active. I also love discovering new cities and restaurants.
